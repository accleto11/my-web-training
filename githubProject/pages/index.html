                            <h1>Introduction to Korean Language</h1>
                            <h2>Overview of the Korean Language</h2>
                            <h3>A Brief History:</h3>
                            <p>The Korean language, with its beautiful and logical script known as Hangul, has a fascinating history. Created in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great, Hangul was designed to be simple enough for everyone to learn, from scholars to everyday people. Before Hangul, Korean was written using Chinese characters, which were difficult for the common people to master. King Sejong’s goal was to provide an accessible writing system that could represent the sounds of the Korean language more accurately, making it easier for everyone to read and write.</p>
                            <h3>
                                Why It Matters:
                            </h3>
                            <p>Korean is spoken by over 75 million people worldwide, making it a language with a rich cultural heritage and global significance. Whether you're interested in Korean culture, planning to travel, or looking to connect with Korean-speaking friends and communities, learning the language opens up a world of opportunities.</p>
                            <h3>
                                What Makes Hangul Unique:
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Hangul stands out for its logical and scientific design. It’s made up of 14 basic consonants and 10 vowels, and the shape of each letter reflects the sound it represents. This unique feature makes Hangul one of the most intuitive writing systems in the world, allowing learners to quickly grasp the basics and start reading and writing with confidence.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
